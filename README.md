# GPXMerge
A simple python script to merge GPX files within a target directory

# About
Sometimes we would like to merge all the tracks, track segments and track points across different [GPS Exchange Format (GPX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) files. You may want to do this to consolidate GPS data generated by your GPS devices. Merging all your GPX files into a single one allows you to easily visualize the spatial information as one single map layer on a mapping software.

**Note that this algorithm**
* Preserves tracks. i.e. it does not merge different tracks under one
* Filters off track points which are not timestamped
* Orders track points chronologically under their track segment

# Usage
Here's an example to run the script with all available options
```sh
python GPXMerge.py -i ./target -o target_merged.gpx -s 30
```

# Options
Longform | Shortform | Optional | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`--input` | `-i` | NO | Input directory path containing GPX files to be merged
`--output` | `-o` | YES | Output path for the merged GPX file. Defaults to be `./[input directory]_merged.gpx`
`--skip-interval` | `-s` | YES | The interval in track segment at which the track points are taken.

The reason to have a skip interval is to provide user control over the granularity of the merged data. Some GPS devices provide 1Hz data which may be too fine-grained for certain tasks.
